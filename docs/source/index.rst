Network Diffusion - docs
=============================================

Network Diffusion is a library that allows to design and run diffusion
phenomena processes in networks. The package has been built based on
`networkx <https://networkx.github.io>`_ and is fully compatible. With Network
Diffusion, the user can work with multi- and single-layer networks, define
propagation models from scratch, use predefined ones, and perform simulations.

Feel free to contribute! We strongly believe in open-source projects. Hence our
library provides open interfaces for new models, metrics, and functions. If you
need to implement a piece of code and, by that, enhance the package, please let
us know in the form of a pull request. In case of any questions, do not hesitate
to contact us: **michal.czuba@pwr.edu.pl**
