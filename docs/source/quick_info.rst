Information about this project
==============================

This project has been created due to the lack of Python tools, which allow
performing process-propagation experiments in the networks (graphs). The current
version of the library contains a multi-process spreading toolset for discrete
phenomena (like 'SIS').

Github repository
=================

All code can be found on GitHub
`repo. <https://github.com/anty-filidor/network_diffusion>`_


Code Ocean capsule
==================

There is an option to make a dry run of the package using an interactive
capsule published at CodeOcean. Visit
`this <https://codeocean.com/capsule/8807709/tree>`_ page to play with Network
Diffusion!

Experiments on LTM model
=========================

`Here <https://github.com/anty-filidor/ltm-seeding-mln>`_ is another project
which bases on this package. You can find there pipelines that evaluate
effectivness of various seed selection methods (like Page Rank or Degree
Centrality) on Linear Threshold Model.
